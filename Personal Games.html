    <strong>This is the list of our personal Game of the Year for the past 5 years</strong>
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>2021 (Current Year) - Scarlet Nexus</b>
    <img src="Images/Nexus.png" alt="Scarlet nexus" style="height: 100px;width: 300px;float: right;">
    <p>For this current year the personal game of the year would be Scarlet Nexus</p>
    <p>This is an action role-playing game that was developed by Bandai Namco and has a Anime and Cartoon based art style.
        It was released on June 25th and is an entirely new IP.
    </p>
    <p>The game has a super unique art style and the developers clearly use this to their advantage as the combat and story all ooze into some beautiful and unique moments that stick in your head for a long time.
        The style is also filled with colour which makes it stand out compared to everything else that we have personally seen this year.
    </p>
    <p>The combat and enemy design is also super interesting as the enemy design is super unique with each enemy being distinct from each other.
        The combat, while simple, allows for depth with the different S.A.S abilities that can be used within the combat that allows for more depth even with the overall simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>Finally the story is conveyed through 2 different perspective and you only get one of them in one of the playthroughs therefore it incentivize playing through the game a second time as the other character to get the full understanding. </p>
    <P>Therefore currently Scarlet Nexus would be the Game of the Year for us.</P>

    <br>
    <b>2020 - Ghost of Tsushima</b>
    <img src="Images/ghost-of-tsushima-image-2.jpg" alt="Ghost of Tsushima" style="height: 200px;width: 300px;float: right;">
    <p>For 2020 would have to go to Ghost of Tsushima</p>
    <p>Ghost of Tsushima was an absolute blast to play through as it started off strong and then just continued to get even better. It was released on July 17th for the PS4 and is also a new IP</p>
    <p>The story for the game is about Jin Sakai and we descent into the Ghost where he begins to question his samurai origins and slowly starts to be less honorable and dillemas arise because of this shift in character.</p>
    <p>The gameplay for this game makes it so you can see the descent of the character as you get access to more and more equipment that any normal samurai would never use and this conveys the story very well. 
        Also the gameplay feels amazing to play as everything has a clear goal for the overall feel which makes the game feel really good 
    </p>
    <p>It is also another game that has a super unique art style with so much colour and unique feel that allows it to stand out from the other games in the same genre.</p>
    <p>Therefore personally Ghost of Tsushima is our 2020 Game of the Year.</p>
    <img src="Images/Ghost.gif" alt="Ghost" style="width: 350px;height: 200px;">
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>2019 - Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</b>
    <img src="Images/sekiro---button-1536103897438.jpg" alt="Sekiro" style="width: 200px; height: 250px; float: right;">
    <p>For 2019 personally game of the year would be Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</p>
    <p>Sekiro is an absolute masterpiece in hard but fair gameplay and this allows for you to know when you are developing as a player and makes you want to play it more to be even better than you were when you started.</p>
    <p>Once again the game has a style that very much fits the look that the game is going for and this makes for some super unique boss fights and leads to almost every fight feeling unique.</p>
    <p>The story has a multiple different endings which makes you want to replay through the game and this allows you to also show off that you have improved as a player.</p>
    <p>Therefore Sekiro is our personal game of the year for 2019.</p>
